🏛️ CivicPulse AI
Local Problem → Data → Action Platform
Turning everyday citizen complaints into data-driven, prioritized, actionable insights for local governments using AI + maps + analytics.
🚀 What is CivicPulse AI?
CivicPulse AI is an end-to-end Smart Governance platform that collects citizen issues (roads, water, waste, streetlights, schools, transport), analyzes them using AI, and helps local authorities prioritize, act, and measure impact.
It bridges the gap between:
❌ scattered complaints (WhatsApp, calls, papers)
✅ structured, visual, decision-ready intelligence
🎯 Problem We Are Solving
Ground Reality (Tamil Nadu / Erode context)
Citizen complaints are unstructured & scattered
No centralized visibility for authorities
No urgency-based prioritization
Decisions are reactive, not data-driven
Result
Delayed fixes
Repeated complaints
Low public trust
Inefficient use of budgets
💡 Our Solution
A web + AI powered civic intelligence system where:
👥 Citizens
Submit issues via text / voice / image
Track status transparently
See resolution history
🧠 AI Engine
Classifies complaint type (roads, waste, water, etc.)
Detects issues from images (potholes, garbage)
Calculates Urgency Score
Predicts Impact Score if fixed
🏛️ Authorities
View city heatmaps
See priority queues
Analyze trends by ward / department
Allocate resources scientifically
✨ Key Innovations (Judge Attention Grabbers)
🔥 Urgency Score
Calculated using:
Safety risk
Complaint frequency
Location criticality
Historical severity
Result: What to fix first, not just what to fix.
📈 Impact Score Prediction
AI estimates:
“If this issue is resolved, how much public impact will it create?”
Helps in:
Budget planning
Performance tracking
Smart City KPI reporting
🤖 Multi-Modal AI
NLP → text + voice complaints
Computer Vision → images
Geo-AI → ward & hotspot analysis
