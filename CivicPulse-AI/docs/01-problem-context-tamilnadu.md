# Civic Problem Context – Tamil Nadu

Urban local bodies in Tamil Nadu face recurring issues:
- Road damage and potholes
- Water supply failures
- Waste accumulation
- Streetlight outages
- Public transport inefficiencies

Current reporting channels:
- WhatsApp messages
- Phone calls
- Physical complaint registers

Key gaps:
- No centralized system
- No data-driven prioritization
- No visibility into trends or impact
- Reactive governance

This results in delayed resolutions and reduced public trust.
